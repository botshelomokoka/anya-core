# Key Management

## Overview

Key Management is a critical component of Anya. Secure key generation, distribution, storage, and revocation are essential for the security of Anya's decentralized applications.

## Key Generation

Anya uses a secure key generation algorithm to generate keys for use in the network. Keys are generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator.

## Key Distribution

Anya provides a secure key distribution system to ensure that keys are distributed securely to authorized parties. Keys are distributed using a secure communication protocol, such as HTTPS or WebSockets.

## Key Storage

Anya provides a secure key storage system to ensure that keys are stored securely. Keys are stored in a secure key store, such as a Hardware Security Module (HSM) or a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).

## Key Revocation

Anya provides a secure key revocation system to ensure that keys can be revoked quickly and easily. Keys are revoked using a secure communication protocol, such as HTTPS or WebSockets.

## Key Management API

Anya provides a Key Management API to allow applications to interact with the key management system. The API provides endpoints for key generation, distribution, storage, and revocation.

## Key Management SDK

Anya provides a Key Management SDK to allow applications to interact with the key management system. The SDK provides libraries for key generation, distribution, storage, and revocation.
