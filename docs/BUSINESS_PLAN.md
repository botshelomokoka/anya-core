    developer_pool: Decimal,
    operational_costs: Decimal
}

impl RevenueDistribution {
    fn distribute(&self) -> Result<Distribution> {
        // API Revenue Split
        // - 40% DAO Treasury
        // - 30% Developer Pool
        // - 30% Operational Costs
    }
}
```

### 2. Pricing Logic

```rust
struct ServicePricing {
    base_rate: Decimal,
    usage_multiplier: f64,
    tier_discount: f64,
    custom_factors: Vec<PricingFactor>
}

impl ServicePricing {
    fn calculate_price(&self, usage: Usage) -> Decimal {
        // Dynamic pricing based on:
        // - Resource utilization
        // - Service tier
        // - Usage volume
